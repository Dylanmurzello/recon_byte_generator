  "content": "Another reason to visit the Beverly Hills Public Library: As of this month, the Rexford Drive destination is the new home of the Paley Archive, which includes over 160,000 television and radio programs and advertisements, as preserved by The Paley Center for Media.\nThe archive spans more than a century of programming, across the genres of comedy, drama, news, public affairs, performing arts, sports, reality, animation, documentary and more. Visitors can experience everything from the oldest offering — a 1918 speech by labor leader Samuel Gompers — to countless historic moments in media like Orson Welles’ infamous “War of the Worlds” broadcast, Jacqueline Kennedy’s tour of the White House and the first broadcast hour of MTV.\nAlso available are recordings of past Paley Center-produced events and star-studded discussions like PaleyFest L.A. — this year’s edition of which starts tonight at the Dolby Theatre and runs through next Saturday.\nThe archive is open during the library’s hours of operation and is managed by the knowledgeable Paley staff. Plus, the Paley will present screenings, conversations and family-friendly events at the library. Until then, I’m Ashley Lee, here with my fellow Times staff writer Jessica Gelt with more arts and culture headlines and happenings.\n‘María Magdalena Campos-Pons: Behold’\nThe Cuban-born artist’s vivid and activism-driven work reflects global histories of enslavement, indentured labor, motherhood, and migration.

This weekend at the museum, Campos-Pons performs with composer and multi-instrumentalist Kamaal Malak (Saturday, 5 p.m.), and discusses her artistic practice with the exhibition‘s curators (Sunday, 4:30 p.m.).

The group‘s current concert pays homage to the Italian composer, as well as those who either studied under him or composed opuses in his honor: George Frideric Handel, Jean-Baptiste Barrière, Francesco Geminiani and Jean-Marie Leclair. This program will be performed Sunday at 7 p.m. at Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels (555 W. Temple St., downtown L.A.) and again in Long Beach (March 28), Laguna Beach (March 29) and Pasadena (March 30). kontrapunktusmusic.org\n— Ashley Lee\nFRIDAY\n🎹 According to Ray: Ray Charles’ Message to America\nIn its season opener, MUSE/IQUE celebrates the work of the genre-defying musician and singer,\n⏰ 7:30 p.m. Friday; 2:30 p.m. Saturday; 2:30 and 7:30 p.m. March 23.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art, 5905 Wilshire Blvd. lacma.org\nMonday night’s severe Coachella Valley windstorm, clocking in at 30 mph with gusts up to 50 mph, took down at least one Desert X sculpture installation, just over a week after the outdoor show’s opening.\nIn Palm Desert, Swiss artist Raphael Hefti had stretched an impossibly long strip of reinforced fire-hose material, jet black on one side and mirror-bright silver on the other, between a high rocky cliff at one end and a tall steel support drilled into the flat desert at the other. Swaying overhead, the aerial strip was roughly 1,300 feet long — more than 3 ½ football fields.\nMonday night’s fierce winds took it down, damaging the support structures in the process. According to workmen at the site, repairs are expected to take a week to 10 days. Here are “before” (above) and “after” (below) photos of the work, titled “Five things you can’t wear on TV,” a sly reference to cautions against wearing pinstripes on camera, lest moiré patterns interfere with a television monitor’s crisp electronic imagery.\n— Christopher Knight\nTo read Knight’s full review of Desert X, click here.\nAfter fire came perilously close to the Getty Villa during January’s devastating Palisades fire, Times art critic Christopher Knight asked a question: Should the Getty and Getty Villa move? Acknowledging that both structures are well protected by state-of-the-art building infrastructure, Knight pointed out that, “Urban fire — explosive structure-to-structure conflagrations, rather than ordinary ignition of wildland vegetation — had arrived at astounding scale.” But where would the collections go? Knight suggested the soon-to-be-vacant Kenneth Hahn Hall of Administration in downtown L.A.\nNeedless to say, readers had many thoughts on Knight’s column and suggestions, so we compiled their letters in a separate story. “Absolutely not! The venue is a big part of both the Center and the Villa. That is what makes the Getty Museums so ‘special.’” wrote one reader. “Yes, definitely. The move to downtown Los Angeles would expose thousands more people to the incredible art of this priceless collection,” wrote another.\nEnjoying this newsletter?

Times theater critic Charles McNulty sat down for an interview with Kaufman and Gronich in New York a few days before their trip to L.A. The main topic of conversation was how the duo turned a photo album featuring the banal daily activities of workers at Auschwitz-Birkenau into a searing play.\nEast West Players, in collaboration with Outside In Theatre, announced a fundraising campaign to make a professional video recording of Lauren Yee’s play, “Cambodian Rock Band,” setting a goal of $15,000. The company reached that goal in under 20 hours and expanded the goal to $25,000. The hope is to preserve the historic work for posterity, and to make it globally accessible. The fundraising campaign will be active through March 31.\nIn his first visit to the John F.
